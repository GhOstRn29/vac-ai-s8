                <p>In a kingdom shaped by dreams and quiet courage, Princess Amisha was known not only for her grace,
                    but for her unstoppable spirit. She was ambitious, always reaching for something brighter beyond the
                    horizon, and passionate about everything she chose to pursue. Whether it was a new idea, a creative
                    project, or a simple act of kindness, she gave her whole heart to it.
                    Her voice carried warmth, her words carried clarity, and her presence made people feel heard. From
                    singing melodies that lifted moods, to expressing herself through art and conversation, she had a
                    rare gift,the ability to turn ordinary moments into something meaningful. Those who walked beside
                    her knew one thing for certain: with Amisha, life always felt a little more inspired.</p>

                <p>Amisha’s magic isn’t found in spells or stardust, it lives in her mindset. She believes in hope, in
                    effort, and in always showing up with enthusiasm. Her presence brings clarity to confusion, warmth
                    to uncertainty, and light to even the quietest moments.
                    She is endlessly resourceful, always finding a way forward, no matter how difficult the path seems.
                    Her positivity lifts hearts, and her willingness to help makes everyone feel supported and stronger.
                    Through her creativity, her voice, and her unwavering spirit, she gently shapes the world around

            <h2>The Path to the Mystic Horizon</h2>
            <div class="poem-content">
                <p>
                    We chose to chase the light<br>
                    Something that lived beyond our sight<br>
                    With bated breath, as we march along<br>
                    In search of a horizon we belong<br>
                    As we reach a pinnacle of a mountain<br>
                    Impugned by a lake which was certain<br>
                    With a zeal, yet grounded with pragmatism<br>
                    Mind and heart both present in the prism<br>
                    The leap could not bend our enthusiasm<br>
                    Together, hand in hand, we spanned the chasm<br>
                    Next we reach the land of mystic sand<br>
                    Galvanized by the scorching sun,<br>
                    As we almost reach the last run<br>
                    Mountains resembled the stage<br>
                    And the Auroras started to amaze<br>
                    A victorious emancipation set to glaze.<br><br>

                    A journey destined for a certain victory,<br>
                    For now it tests the strength of your intensity.<br>
                    Let’s pledge to keep chasing the dream,<br>
                    The way we chased light in that magical realm.<br><br>

                    Happy Birthday Amisha!<br>
                    Have a focused mind and heart always clear<br>
                    Keep the virtue strong,<br>
                    Be jocund and victorious year on year.
